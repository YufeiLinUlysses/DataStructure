1. When would a linked list be a better choice than a dynamic array?
2. When would a dynamic array be a better choice than a linked list?

I am answering these two questions combined. By definiton, a dynamic array is an array that is able to 
resize itself based on the number of content it has even though, it may be initialized much larger than
the actual number of content in the array. However, this array cannot have number of content that is over
the size it is initialized to be. An array is fast in calling the element by index. We just need to input the index,
then we can get the element. The weakness of this data strcuture is that for insertion and delete, we need to 
find a way to store the existing data and convert them to a new array. That is when linked list could become
handy. Although searching may be more difficult, the insertion and deletion is very fast for any element. And 
the problem of this data strcuture is searching. Therefore, if one would like to search more frequently by index,
the best data strcuture to choose is an array. Other than that the best data strcuture is to use linked list.
